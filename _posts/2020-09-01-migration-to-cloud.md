## Migration to Google Big Query
Goal is to gain speed and scalability in data processing by migrating to Google cloud solution. This requires
design of the table relationships, optimization of SQL queries and implementation of ETL data pipelines with
Apache Airflow.

You just need to describe how you made it.  


## Duration 
You can enter the period in a convenient format.   
You may specify only the duration of your work, assuming that you create a start date in the filename.
