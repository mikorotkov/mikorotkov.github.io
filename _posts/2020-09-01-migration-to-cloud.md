## Goal
Goal is to gain speed and scalability in data processing by migrating to Google cloud solution. This requires
design of the table relationships, optimization of SQL queries and implementation of ETL data pipelines with
Apache Airflow.  


## Technique
I'm currently in the process of migrating our infrastructure to the Google Cloud platform. As a scheduling tool Apache Airflow was chosen for which I created various data pipelines to process, clean up and load data into data warehouse in BigQuery.
