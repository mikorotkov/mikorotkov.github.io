## Partner reporting automation
The goal of the project was to give senior management comprehensive overview of the performance across business
units. It was achieved by clearly defined set of KPIs for each business unit and creation visual representation in
Power BI of the dependencies between various KPIs.   


## Techique
I wrote that I used python to run the project.  
You just need to describe how you made it.  


## Duration 
You can enter the period in a convenient format.   
You may specify only the duration of your work, assuming that you create a start date in the filename.
