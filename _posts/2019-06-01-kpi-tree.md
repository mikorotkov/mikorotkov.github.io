## Goal
The goal of the project was to give management comprehensive overview of the performance across business
units. It was achieved by clearly defined set of KPIs for each business unit and creation visual representation in
Power BI of the dependencies between various KPIs.   


## Techique
The process started with defining KPIs (based on [Kaushik's Impact Matrix](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/impact-matrix-digital-analytics-framework/)) on several dimensions first within Business intelligence unit, then with department heads and finally with the management.

After placing KPIs in the appropriate place based on the matrix, they can be grouped into 4 segments of analytics maturity/complexity as follows:

Based on this set of KPIs report was created that shows how these KPIs influence each other and how they influence the bottom line of the business. E.g.:
