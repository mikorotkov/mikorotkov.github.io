## Goal
The goal was to add Search Console data to SEO reporting, since data there is stored only for last 3 months. API 
was implemented and ETL process designed in SSIS to save the data in DWH. The data was then added into the 
SEO report.


## Techique
I wrote that I used python to run the project.  
You just need to describe how you made it.  


## Duration 
You can enter the period in a convenient format.   
You may specify only the duration of your work, assuming that you create a start date in the filename.
