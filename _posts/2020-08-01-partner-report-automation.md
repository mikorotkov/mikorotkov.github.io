## Partner reporting automation
Goal was to integrate data from partner into our own data warehouse and create performance report based on
this data. Created requirements for API implementation by partner, created ETL process for data integration
and created the report.  


## Techique
I wrote that I used python to run the project.  
You just need to describe how you made it.  


## Duration 
You can enter the period in a convenient format.   
You may specify only the duration of your work, assuming that you create a start date in the filename.
