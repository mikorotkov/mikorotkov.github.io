## Goal
Goal was to integrate data from partner into our own data warehouse and create performance report based on
this data. 


## Techique
Together with marketing channel owner I defined KPIs and metrics that are needed and therefore data that needs to be exposed in the API by the partner.

Based on out requirements partner implemented the API. Data was further cleaned, processed and aggeregated throtugh Microsoft SSIS.

Based on this data, as well as data from CRM provider and internal site data, report in Power BI was created based on the requirements of the marketing channel owner.
