## Goal
Goal is to create business intelligence department in the company.  


## Techique
By analysing the data needs and data literacy of the stakeholders, I was able to define the startegy and the roadmap for its implemetation. The work started with assesing and comparing multiple tools that can be used for different parts of BI infrastructure. At the same time we started looking at the data sources and developing a strategy for storing the data in the efficient yet easily usable way. Implementation is still on going however the process is clear and defined and can be scaled up easily.
