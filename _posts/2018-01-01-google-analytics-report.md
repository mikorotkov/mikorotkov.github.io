## Goal
The goal was to simplify reporting used for the B2B customers. The data from Google Analytics is extracted with
the API into Google sheets and created script cleans up and prepares the data to use in Google Data Studio for
report preparation.

## Duration 
You can enter the period in a convenient format.   
You may specify only the duration of your work, assuming that you create a start date in the filename.
