## Partner reporting automation
Majority of marketing reporting was done manually by copy/pasting data between excel files. I automated the process
using ETL tool. Automation saved around 8 hours of manual work weekly.   


## Techique
I wrote that I used python to run the project.  
You just need to describe how you made it.  


## Duration 
You can enter the period in a convenient format.   
You may specify only the duration of your work, assuming that you create a start date in the filename.
