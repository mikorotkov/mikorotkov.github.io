## Partner reporting automation
A lot of reports are in different formats (Excel, Salesforce, Metabase etc.) and not centralized. I lead the team that
migrated reports from different platforms, adjusted data visualization for Power BI and rolled out the new tool across
the company.  


## Techique
I wrote that I used python to run the project.  
You just need to describe how you made it.  


## Duration 
You can enter the period in a convenient format.   
You may specify only the duration of your work, assuming that you create a start date in the filename.
